    st.write('''Demand forecasting is an analytical technique used for predicting the demand for a product over time. 
    In simple terms, it enables you to estimate future sales so that you can plan your stock levels accordingly.
But, demand forecasting has much bigger superpowers than simply telling you how much stock to order. 
It can also help you to achieve the following.  \n

**1. Practice informed inventory planning**  \n
Informed inventory planning reduces the amount of unsellable stock that you hold while ensuring that you donâ€™t sell out of popular items. 
This means that you can meet demand without slow-moving stock draining your warehouse space or profits.  \n

**2. Better manage your cashflow**  \n
With less money tied up in slow-moving stock and more awareness of when to buy more stock, 
you can better plan your other budgets throughout the year, such as research and development.  \n

**3. Plan marketing, advertisements, and discounts**  \n
Knowing the points in the year when a product will sell well or struggle can help you to 
better plan your marketing, advertising, and discounting activities.  \n

**4. Negotiate**  \n
And, being able to forecast your sales can also assist with supplier, lender, and other negotiations that are taking place.  \n
